# About Me

I am a font-end developer based in the beautiful state of Maine. I'm passionate about coding and all things related to JavaScript. I previously worked as a spatial data analyst and have many years of experience programming in Python. Web maps got me hooked on front-end development.

## What's New?

Read about the latest [projects](projects) that I've been working on, such as the [People's Guide to Energy](posts/pge-1). Also, check out my latest articles in the [blog](blog) section of my website. I like to write about all things HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
