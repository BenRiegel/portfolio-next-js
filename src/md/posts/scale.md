# Large Scale vs Small Scale

In cartography, the scale of a map refers to the relationship between a measurement of an object on the map (e.g. the area of a lake) and the corresponding measurement of the actual object on the Earth’s surface. Scale is commonly expressed as a ratio. For example, a scale value of 1:24,000 indicates that an object that is one inch on the map is 24,000 inches on the Earth’s surface.

The concept of scale is relatively fairly straightforward. However, things can get confusing when a map is described as “large” scale or “small” scale. When cartographers refer to a large-scale map, what they mean is that it includes a smaller amount of area but a larger amount of detail. Let’s suppose that we have two maps of the same area: map A has a 1:24,000 scale; map B has a scale of 1:100,000. 

Map A: 1:24,000

Map B: 1:100,000

In map A, one inch on the map corresponds to 24,000 inches on the Earth’s surface; in map B, one inch on the map corresponds to 100,000 inches on the Earth’s surface. Thus, map A features less area but more detail. Map B features more area but less detail. In this scenario, map A is considered to have a larger scale than map B. Why? If we consider the scale as a fraction and then convert that value to a decimal, map A has a scale of 1/24,000 or 0.00004167, while map B has a scale of 1/100,000 or 0.00001. Expressed as a decimal, map A has a larger scale value so it is considered to have a larger scale.

Things get confusing because the cartographer’s definition of scale is basically the opposite of the colloquial usage of “scale.” According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, large-scale means [“covering or involving a large area”](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/large-scale). The large scale map *should* be map B because it depicts a larger area. This gets confusing when you’re reading something about maps and a particular map is referred to as having a “large scale.” I often have to stop reading and try to figure out based on context, what is meant. Sometimes it’s clear and sometimes it’s not. I also conside who the author is and ask whether they are a trained cartographer and thus would be more likely to be using the counter-intuitive definition of "large scale" and "small scale."

If it were up to me, I would just use the colloquial definitions. I get that cartographers are thinking of scale as a decimal, but in that case, it should be expressed as a decimal on a map. Instead, it is usually expressed as a ratio. In any case, in my writing, if I refer to a “large scale” map, I like to say something like “large scale (zoomed in)” just to be clear. Everyone understands the concept of a map being zoomed in, so I think this is a good way to avoid confusion. I don't know if it works in every context, but it should work in most.
