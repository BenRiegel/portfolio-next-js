# PGE Project, Reflections

The PGE project website was my first major project after completing the my front-end development bootcamp. Overall, it was a success: it accomplished all the main goals that I hoped to accomplish. And more importantly, my client was happy. And I was happy too. Early on, I had an idea for what I wanted the web map application to do and what it should look it. But I didn't know whether I would be able to implement it or not. In the end, I was able to figure out how to do it, and that was really rewarding.

In hindsight, this was a *very* ambitious project to attempt at that time. As discussed in the [previous](pge-2) post, this involved three major challenges: 1) rendering and updating items in the web map, 2) getting all the components of the application to work together, and 3) incorporating asyncronous events. A project that focused on any one of these would be a major undertaking, but attempting to tackle all three together was quite a lot to bite off.

In the end, however, I was glad that I did it. Perhaps the most valuable part was learning how to design web applications. I first began to program back in high school and for a long time I've understood the concepts of object-oriented programming. But I didn't know about application architecture. My front-end bootcamp touched on these issues, and I learned how to use an application framework (Angular). In creating a web mapping application using vanilla JavaScript, I really learned about the challenges associated with managing application state. I struggled a lot in figuring out how to approach it. I would try one approach, figure out that it didn't scale well, and then I had to go back and undo it. Eventually, I figured out a pattern that works. In the end, my understanding of architectural concepts is much more solid than previously. I have a much better understanding of how to approach the design of future web application projects.
